            You might wonder, what's the relationship between both? 
            It may seem like nothing but I believe the best way to know a human being is through a computer. 
            This is why I specialized in Front-end with Javascript (mostly). Do you want to know more about me?

            <p data-aos='fade-down'>I am an organized, empathic, friendly and creative developer who doesn't see a limit when learning. 
            Really, if I want to learn it, I learn it. 
            I love concerts, cats, dogs, going to the cinema, traveling, listening to music, reading a good book or talking with good friends, and especially fixing the bugs in my code.

            <p data-aos='fade-down'>So, check my work!</p>
